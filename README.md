## Election-Audit Summary
The program to process the election results from the election_results.csv file completes the task of outputting the results in a concise logical manner. However, there is potential to modify the program to allow the program to process results from any election. Two modifications come to mind. One is to add an option to specify the file path of any raw election results data provided that the data is formatted prior to running the program. The second is to change the output results to general descriptions to allow for use in other word processing programs for distribution to print media or online websites.
